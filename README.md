# Writing an Interpreter in Go

This repository contains the Go code for the Monkey interpreter as described in the book [Writing an Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/).

I am following the book and implementing the interpreter in Go. I am also adding tests and comments to the code as I go along.
